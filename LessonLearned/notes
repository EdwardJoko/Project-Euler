    2. Dynamic Programming
       By saving the result of previous computation can reduce the
       amount of time of computation significantly.

    3. The number of factor before and after the square root of a
       number is the same. For example, the number 36,
       1, 2, 3, 4, '6', 9, 12, 18, 36.
       36 have 4 factors before 6 and also the same after 6. 36 is
       a special case, because it has perfect square root.

    4. The number of divisors of a number is the multiplication of
       the exponents number + 1 of its prime factor.
       Let suppose a number N, let pn-s are its prime factors, so
       N = (p1)^(a1) + (p2)^(a2) + ...
       so, the number of divisors of N is, D(N),
       D(N) = (a1 + 1) * (a2 + 1) * ...

       for, example, 18 = 2^(1) * 3^(2), so the number of divisors
       is, D(18) = (1 + 1) * (2 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6. It's because,
       all the factor of 18 is the multiplication of its prime fac-
       tor, see table below,

            2^0 2^1
       3^0   1   2
       3^1   3   6
       3^2   9   18
