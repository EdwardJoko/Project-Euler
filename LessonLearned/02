       iterator?
       It's because, look at the following series,

           1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16

       the loop only iterate to the point where i is equal to 4. How can we be
       sure that all the non-prime number is eliminated from the list?

       It's because if a number is less than 16, and the number is a composite
       number, and one of its factor is bigger than 4, let's call this factor
       a, then, the other factor would be less than 4, let's call this number b.
       Then we can be sure that the composite number that is less than 16,
       would be eliminated when the iterator is equal to b.

       Otherwise, if a and b is bigger than 4, then, the composite number
       would be bigger than 16. Because a > 4, and b > 4, so a * b > 4 * 4.
       That exceed our limit.
